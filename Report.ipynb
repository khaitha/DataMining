    "- **Bipartite Graph**: A type of graph where nodes can be divided into two distinct sets, and edges only connect nodes from different sets (e.g., users and items).\n",
    "- **Node**: A point in the graph representing an entity, such as a user or an item.\n",
    "- **Edge**: A connection between two nodes, representing a relationship or interaction (e.g., a user rating a movie).\n",
    "- **Random Walk**: A process of traversing the graph by moving from one node to a connected node at random.\n",
    "- **Edge Weight**: A value assigned to an edge, representing the strength or importance of the connection (e.g., a rating score).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Bipartite Graph?\n",
    "A bipartite graph is a special type of graph where the nodes can be divided into two distinct sets, and edges only connect nodes from different sets. For example, in a recommendation system, one set of nodes could represent users, and the other set could represent items (like movies, products, or services). Interactions between users and items, such as ratings or purchases, are represented as edges connecting the two sets. This structure makes bipartite graphs particularly useful for modeling relationships in recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pixie-Inspired Algorithms\n",
    "Pixie-inspired recommendation systems are graph-based methods designed to deliver personalized suggestions by analyzing the structure of a bipartite graph. The Pixie algorithm, originally developed by Pinterest, is a lightweight and scalable approach that uses random walks on the graph to identify items relevant to a user. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering techniques, Pixie-inspired methods are particularly effective for handling sparse datasets and large-scale graphs, making them well-suited for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of Pixie-inspired algorithms is the idea of **random walks**. A random walk is a process where you start at a specific node (like a user or an item) and move to a connected node at each step, choosing randomly from the neighbors of the current node. This continues for a set number of steps, and the nodes visited during the walk are ranked based on how often they are encountered. For example, in a movie recommendation system, starting a random walk from a user node allows the algorithm to explore movies rated by similar users or movies frequently co-rated with the user’s preferences. This approach captures both direct and indirect relationships in the graph, helping to uncover items that are relevant but not immediately obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random walks work well for recommendations because they naturally take advantage of the graph’s structure to spread influence across nodes. For instance, if a user has rated a movie highly, the random walk can move to other users who have rated the same movie and then explore their preferences. This helps reveal hidden patterns, like niche movies that are popular among a specific group of users. Additionally, the weighted nature of the random walk (where transitions are influenced by edge weights, such as rating scores) ensures that stronger connections are prioritized, leading to more accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixie-inspired algorithms are widely used in industry because they are scalable and effective. For example, Pinterest uses a Pixie-based system to recommend pins to users by analyzing the bipartite graph of users and pins. Similarly, e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart can use these methods to suggest products based on purchase histories and co-purchase patterns. Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify can apply random walks to recommend movies, TV shows, or songs by exploring user-item interaction graphs. Their ability to handle large-scale, sparse datasets makes Pixie-inspired algorithms a powerful tool for any platform that relies on personalized recommendations."

    "#### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie recommendation systems are a huge asset in the modern digital platforms, helping users discover content based on their preferences. These systems are widely used in streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+, as well as e-commerce platforms like Amazon. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, recommendation systems enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we implemented three distinct approaches to movie recommendation:\n",
    "1. **User-based collaborative filtering**: Recommends movies to a user based on the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "2. **Item-based collaborative filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those a user has already rated highly.\n",
    "3. **Random-walk-based Pixie algorithm**: A graph-based approach that uses weighted random walks to recommend movies by exploring user-movie relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and together they provide a comprehensive understanding of recommendation system design.\n",
