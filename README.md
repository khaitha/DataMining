Movie recommendation systems are a huge asset in the modern digital platforms, helping users discover content based on their preferences. These systems are widely used in streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+, as well as e-commerce platforms like Amazon. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, recommendation systems enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and retention.

In this project, we implemented three distinct approaches to movie recommendation:

- User-based collaborative filtering: Recommends movies to a user based on the preferences of similar users.
- Item-based collaborative filtering: Recommends movies similar to those a user has already rated highly.
- Random-walk-based Pixie algorithm: A graph-based approach that uses weighted random walks to recommend movies by exploring user-movie relationships.

Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and together they provide a comprehensive understanding of recommendation system design.

This notebook will guide you to the basics and common we can create our own recommendation system.
